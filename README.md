# The currency of academia

Academic often say that citations are the currency of academia - Now they literally are. We already work for fake non-money like letters of recommendation, authorship, citations, or even the vague whiff of a permanent position. Now Citations are a real, tolkenised currency the blockchain. 

Citation is a cryptocurrency token on the Solana network that is 100% backed by citations of academic research articles by other researchers. 

Citations are then yours to hold, transfer to others, or even sell I guess. Maybe you could offer them to your undergraduate research assistant in lieu of a wage in $$$. Weirder things happen in academia every day, we've gotten away with paying them in letters of recommendation for years and they don't seem to have noticed. Much easier to click a button, I reckon.

## 'Why would you do this..'

Because what good academic doesn't want a new metric or form of internet points to argue over? And what better way to make Twitter discourse even more intolerable than melding Academic Twitter and Crypto Twitter. 

## Is this real?

Yup. Any researcher can claim their Citation tokens for free, as an airdrop. You get as many Citation tokens as you have citations listed on Google Scholar. To do this, open a github issue [here](https://github.com/citation-coin/citation-coin/issues) with (1) your [ORCID](https://orcid.org), (2) a link to your [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) profile, and (3) your public wallet address for a Solana wallet. Please list either "[Airdrop]" or "[Update]" in your issue's name; [Airdrop] for your first transfer and [Update] if you're requesting additional tokens to reflect updated citations of your work on Google Scholar. 

## What is a wallet / wallet address and where do I get one?

//to be fleshed out.

One accessible option is to download the [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com) app to your iOS or Android phone. Follow the instructions to make a wallet and record your recovery passphrase somewhere. Click receive, find Citations among the list, copy the wallet address (a long alphanumeric string) and paste it into your github issue.
